<br>
</div>
<div class="text_area">
<ul>
Software defined network is a new architecture paradigm devised to obtain more flexibility and efficiency in communication service provisioning. It is based on the separation of data and control plane to allow direct reconfiguration of the network and virtualization of network functions. Openflow is an important protocol standard currently used for the communication between controller and network elements (switches). This project aims to evaluate the gains of this architecture and investigate innovations to allow better scalability and performance of this approach.

<br>
</div>
<div class="text_area">
<ul>
Multihomed systems have more than one Internet connection. This condition is initially used to increase the resilience, but may also provide an improvement in communication quality in terms of reduced latency and packet losses and increase the throughput. Some time ago, SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) has been standardized by the IETF as a new layer protocol 4, joining the TCP and UDP protocols currently in use. This support multistream and multihomed systems. This project aims to study methods of path selection for improving the communication performance.

<ul>
The video streaming is already the main source of Internet traffic.
The same will occur with traffic in mobile networks.
Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the standard used in most countries, including Brazil.
We are interested to evaluate the performance of LTE resource scheduling methods for video traffic, and develop new algorithms.
The development is performed using the NS3 simulator.

<div class="post_title"> Design and Analysis of Cognitive Radio Systems
<br>
</div>
<div class="text_area">
<ul>
This project is focused in the proposal and analysis of new communication schemes using the paradigm of cognitive radio, in order to increase performance and reduce energy consumption of wireless communications. In cognitive radio networks, secondary users (unlicensed) may transmit in the same frequency band which is already being used by the primary users (licensed), with the condition that did not affect the primary users, resulting in more efficient use of licensed frequency bands. If there is more bandwidth available due to a suitable spectral management, it is possible reduce power to achieve the desired transmission capacity. It will be important to identify the trade-off between energy efficiency and service quality, which in turn imposes additional challenges in the design of MAC layer protocols in cognitive radio systems. These challenges this project aims to address the development of medium access mechanisms that are able to adapt in time of changes in the surrounding environment, strategies for spectrum sharing between primary and secondary users and design of algorithms by applying the exchange of information between the various network layers (multilayer). Another objective is to investigate the impact this technology on the performance of wireless communications systems such as cognitive ad hoc networks, mobile communication systems and wireless sensor networks and its possible application in Smart Grid Systems.

<div class="post_title"> Multimedia transmission strategies for VoD systems
<br>

<div class="text_area">
<ul>
Due to the large volume of traffic, the systems will be required to implement IPTV multicast transmission in the network core. For channels transmitted in broadcast technology available is adequate. However, considering VoD systems, new challenges to multicast deployment, in order to reduce bandwidth requirements - the use of multicast transmission techniques currently available to provide VoD systems presents problems in the quality of service offered, resulting in reduction in the level user interaction. The goal of the project is to propose new algorithms to overcome the current methods available. Carlos Marcelo Pedroso (project coordinator), Marcio Fabiano Iavorski, Vinicius José Grain.

The main objective of this project is to study the quality of experience in IPTV systems, having as main target the quality degradation caused by errors in data transmission over the packet network. Secondary objectives are: implementation of algorithms for improving QoE, modeling the video quality degradation as a function of QoS parameters.

<div class="post_title"> Analysis of use of LTE for Smartgrid Communication (closed)
<br>
</div>
<div class="text_area">
<ul>
Technology 3GPP (Long Term Evolution, LTE) is considered a promising solution for integration Smartgrid systems because it provides bandwidth and low latency. However, the LTE was not originally designed for applications of this type, which have restrictions on delay and loss. The goal of this project is the analysis of strategies for the use of LTE for Smartgrid communication, including particular issues of implementation of LTE system in Brazil. The specific objectives are: (1) evaluation of performance of Smartgrid using the LTE, (2) evaluation of mechanisms of quality of service of LTE to support Smartgrid applications, (3) evaluation of the effects of background traffic in QoS parameters and (4) evaluation of the LTE uplink scheduling algorithms to support the requirements of the Smartgrid. This part of a large project between many research intitute in Brasil, including Parana Federal University, Parana Technological Federal University, Pontifical University of Parana, Technische Universitat Dresden (Germany), Kungliga Tekniska hogskolan (Sweden). Waiting approval of Brazilian National Research Council. Reseachers: Carlos Marcelo Pedroso (project coordinator), Eduardo Parente Ribeiro, Luis Lolis, Evélio M. G.Fernández, Cibele Castro, and many others.

<div class="post_title"> Development of a new model for VoIP traffic characterization (Closed)
<br>
</div>
<div class="text_area">
<ul>
The classical models used for telephone traffic modeling can not be used for modeling of Voice over Internet communication (VoIP), for two main reasons: (1) the session time in VoIP systems present higher probability of occurrence of extreme values​​, which differs from the classical approach that uses Markovian models and (2) the traffic profile generated depends heavily on the encoding / decoding (codec) in use. Thus, if the classical theory modeling of voice systems is applied to VoIP, the system tends to underestimate the traffic demand. This project aims to analyze samples collected in real traffic telecom operators and propose a model to characterize a system appropriately VoIP.
